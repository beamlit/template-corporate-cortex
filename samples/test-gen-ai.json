We are particularly interested in applications for customer service, content creation, and data analysis.\n\nWhat are the implementation considerations, including costs, infrastructure requirements, and potential risks or limitations? Are there any case studies from similar companies that have successfully deployed these technologies?\n\nThanks,\nMichael Rodriguez\nVP, Business Strategy\nExt: 2345"
