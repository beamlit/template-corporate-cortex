**Subject:** Question about AI tools for software development

## Message Content
Hello IT Support,

Our development team is interested in exploring AI-powered coding assistants to improve our productivity. We have heard about GitHub Copilot, but we would like to know what other alternatives are available in the market right now, their key features, and how they compare.

Also, does our company already have any licenses for such tools? If not, what would be the process to evaluate and potentially procure one of these tools?

Thanks,
