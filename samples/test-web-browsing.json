We have heard about GitHub Copilot, but we would like to know what other alternatives are available in the market right now, their key features, and how they compare.\n\nAlso, does our company already have any licenses for such tools? If not, what would be the process to evaluate and potentially procure one of these tools?\n\nThanks,\nDavid Kim\nSenior Software Engineer\nExt: 4567"
