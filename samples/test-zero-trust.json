Given the increasing number of remote workers and cloud services in our organization, I believe we should consider implementing this security model.\n\nCould you provide information on the current best practices for Zero Trust implementation? What are the key components we would need to consider, and what are the latest tools and technologies in this space?\n\nAlso, how does our current security architecture compare to Zero Trust principles? Would this require a complete overhaul of our systems or could we implement it incrementally?\n\nThanks,\nJennifer Park\nDirector, Information Security\nExt: 5678"
