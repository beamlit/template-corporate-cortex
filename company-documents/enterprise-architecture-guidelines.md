# Enterprise Architecture Design Guidelines

## Overview

This document outlines TechCorp's enterprise architecture design guidelines, principles, and standards. These guidelines ensure that our technology decisions align with business objectives, promote interoperability, and enable scalable, secure, and maintainable systems.

## Architecture Principles

### Business Alignment

1. **Business-Driven Architecture**
   - All architecture decisions must support defined business objectives
   - Technology investments must demonstrate clear business value
   - Architecture roadmaps must align with business strategy

2. **Cost Effectiveness**
   - Total cost of ownership must be considered in all architecture decisions
   - Reuse existing capabilities before building or buying new ones
   - Standardize on platforms to reduce support and maintenance costs

3. **Agility and Adaptability**
   - Design for change and evolution
   - Minimize dependencies between systems
   - Enable rapid response to changing business needs

### Technical Excellence

4. **Simplicity**
   - Prefer simple solutions over complex ones
   - Minimize technical diversity
   - Eliminate unnecessary redundancy

5. **Standards Compliance**
   - Adhere to industry standards where applicable
   - Follow internal standards and patterns
   - Document exceptions with clear justification

6. **Security by Design**
   - Security must be designed in, not added later
   - Apply defense in depth strategies
   - Follow least privilege principles

### Operational Efficiency

7. **Scalability**
   - Design for horizontal and vertical scaling
   - Plan for growth in data volume and user base
   - Avoid single points of failure

8. **Observability**
